# RFID_125kHz
Example software on using the Bostin Technology 125kHz RFID Raspberry Pi

Turn your Raspberry Pi into an intelligent data collector using the 125KHz RFID Reader. Installed without any additional drivers, the  RFID Reader uses existing facilities (UART and one of four GPIOS pins, user selectable) on the Raspberry Pi to link to a RFID module and detect the presence of RFID tags.  
 
This repository offers example software (both C code and Python) on how to setup the Reader and how to monitor the RFID tags.  The uses are endless - what will you design with the 125KHz RFID Reader?
